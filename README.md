# Task-10-Password-Strength-Analyzer
This project is a simple Python-based tool that checks the strength of a password based on predefined security rules. It helps users understand how secure their passwords are and encourages the use of strong passwords.

Tools Used:

VS Code or Jupyter Notebook

How It Works:

The script checks a password against several criteria:

Minimum length of 8 characters

Contains at least one uppercase letter

Contains at least one lowercase letter

Contains at least one number

Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+=-[]{};:'",.<>?/)

If the password meets all the rules, it is marked Strong, otherwise Moderate or Weak based on missing elements.

How to Run:

Save the script as password_checker.py

Run in terminal or Jupyter:

python password_checker.py


Enter a password when prompted

The program will display whether your password is Weak, Moderate, or Strong

Example Output:
